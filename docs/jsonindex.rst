JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight open standard data-interchange file format, that uses human readable text for transmitting data.
Although you may conclude from the name that it's a Javascript data format. Well, not exactly, JSON is a text format that is completely language independent and uses conventions that are familiar of most popular programming languages such as Python.
